# This is the culmination of many hours of my life.
What has once started as a tiny project to port one of my games on scratch, has become a multi-year process to make one of the best pygame platformers that I know of. Yes it may not look like much to the average "gamer" but this project has pushed my mental sanity to it's limmits. So finaly, let me introduce my magnum opus: Untitled Pygame Platformer (or something).
# What can it do?
* Physics based movement
* A level system
* Descrete level files
* Unlimited platform positions
* Polygons!
* A (simple) level editor
* A costomizable camera
* Much much more (in the future)
# What about the future?
This is not the best platformer out there. However, I created this. I did this with little help and with the added bonus of having to deal with school. Yes I could use Unity or Unreal to make a +1000% better game, but it wouldn't be the same. That, pygame, is a double edged sward. Yes it may be fun to complete something, but it takes a ton of time and effort to complete rudimentary bullet points. So until I lose motivation, I will be working on this game.
